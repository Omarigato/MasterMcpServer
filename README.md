## 🎮 Magic in Action

### Create a Database Server:
```
Create MCP server called "Database" that handles MySQL, PostgreSQL operations with tools: ConnectDatabase,ExecuteQuery,GetTableSchema,BackupDatabase
```

### Create a File Management Server:
```
Generate server template: files with name "FileManager"
```

### Create an Email Server:
```
Create MCP server called "EmailSender" that sends emails via SMTP and SendGrid with tools: SendEmail,SendBulkEmail,ManageTemplates
```

### Start Your New Server:
```
Start server DatabaseServer
```

### Monitor Everything:
```
Get server status
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Setup Master Server

1. **Create project directory:**
   ```bash
   mkdir MasterMcpServer
   cd MasterMcpServer
   ```

2. **Add the project files** (from the artifacts above)

3. **Build and run:**
   ```bash
   dotnet build
   dotnet run
   ```

### 2. Configure VS Code

Create `.vscode/mcp.json`:
```json
{
  "servers": {
    "master-mcp-server": {
      "type": "stdio", 
      "command": "dotnet",
      "args": ["run", "--project", "C:\\Path\\To\\MasterMcpServer"]
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Start Creating Servers!

Once Master is running, you can create unlimited specialized servers:

```
Create MCP server called "WeatherPro" that provides advanced weather analytics with tools: GetWeatherForecast,GetClimateData,GetWeatherAlerts,AnalyzeWeatherPatterns
```

## 🔄 Complete Workflow Example

1. **Create a specialized server:**
   ```
   Create MCP server called "TaskManager" that manages todo lists and projects with tools: CreateTask,CompleteTask,GetProjectStatus,GenerateReports
   ```

2. **Master automatically:**
   - Generates complete C# project
   - Creates all tools with proper MCP attributes
   - Updates VS Code configuration
   - Builds the project

3. **Start the new server:**
   ```
   Start server TaskManager
   ```

4. **Use immediately in VS Code:**
   ```
   Create a new task called "Learn MCP development" with priority high
   ```

5. **Monitor and manage:**
   ```
   Get server status`
   ```

## 🎯 Advanced Features

### Dynamic Tool Addition
```
Add tool to server TaskManager: SendTaskReminder with parameters: taskId:string:Task identifier,reminderTime:datetime:When to send reminder
```

### Server Health Monitoring
- CPU and memory usage
- Uptime tracking  
- Request/error counting
- Thread monitoring

### Configuration Management
- Automatic VS Code mcp.json updates
- Environment variable management
- Port configuration
